# install

    brew cask install agnoster/synergykm/synergy

# why

 - [Synergy](http://synergy-project.org) is rad, but they don't provide binaries to easily install via cask, and I install all my binaries via cask.
 - [SynergyKM](http://synergykm.com) provides binary packages to install.
 - [homebrew-cask doesn't want to provide a cask for the SynergyKM binaries](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask/pull/9762)
 - If you're using this and you find it valuable, consider buying a membership to Synergy and/or donating to SynergyKM

Thanks to @JacopKane for the initial PR to cask!
